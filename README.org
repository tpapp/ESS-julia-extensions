This is an experiment to improve the integration of [[https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS][ESS]] and [[https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/][Julia]], especially the interaction with the Julia REPL. 

For now, the code is kept separate from ESS, and can be installed along with the latest version of ESS. I hope that once ESS is updated to depend on [[https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/pull/122][julia-mode]], this repository will be integrated into ESS; then it will be deleted.

* Where it improves on ESS

Evaluating code from the source buffer into the REPL will

1. keep track of files and line numbers, leading to more meaningful error messages,

2. if the code is within a module, it will be evaluated in that module, allowing incremental development of modules, similarly to [[http://junolab.org/][Juno]].

* Usage

For now, you will need to include the following line in =.juliarc.jl=:

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  include("path-to/ESS-julia-extensions/ess-julia-extensions.jl")
#+END_SRC
and load the Emacs Lisp code, eg
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (load "path-to/ESS-julia-extensions/ess-julia-extensions.el")
#+END_SRC
with the paths, of course, depending on where you cloned this repo.

It will take over the =C-RET=, =C-c C-r=, and =C-c C-c= keybindings in Julia buffers.

All the code is experimental: improvements, suggestions and pull requests are welcome.
